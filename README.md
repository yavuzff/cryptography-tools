In order to access the cryptography software with interface, run `main.py` in the `cryptography-tools-software` folder. Ensure that `backend.py` is in the same folder.
Alternatively, access the command-line version of the software by running `cryptographyToolsTextBased.py`. Ensure numpy and tkinter are installed. If you want to be able to display graphs, ensure matplotlib is installed.
